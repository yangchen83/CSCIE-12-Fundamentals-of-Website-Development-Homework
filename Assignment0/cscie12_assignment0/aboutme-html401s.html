      <h2>What do I do?</h2>
      
      <p>I'm a postdoc at the <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu">Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health</a>.
      <p>I'm working in <a href="http://www.dimopoulosgroup.org">Dr.Dimopoulos' lab</a>. 
      The main goal of our lab is to understand the immune system of mosquitoes, 
      which are vectors of diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.
      The idea is that if we can help mosquitoes fight against pathogens, 
      they would not be able to transmit the diseases to human beings.
      <p>I'm currently working on characterizing an important molecule in the mosquito immune system, 
      and I'm also trying to generate transgenic mosquitoes that can resist malaria parasite infection.</p>

      <h2>What am I going to do after this class?</h2>
      
      <p>As you can see, our <a href="http://www.dimopoulosgroup.org">lab webpage</a> is very outdated. Half of the lab members listed there have left already and 
      I'm not listed there although I have been working there for over 2 years.
      So after finishing this class, I'm going to build a new webpage for our lab using the skills I will be learning.</p>
      <p>I'm also thinking of getting a certificate or even a master degree.</p>
